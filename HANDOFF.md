# Session Handoff — Dynasty Fantasy Football

## Current State

Both leagues are **fully built and deployed**. The auto-update data pipeline is running on schedule. No outstanding work on either league.

- **CLTC 8 2017**: https://cltcdynasty.vercel.app

## What Was Completed (Most Recent Sessions)

### CLTC Parity (Complete)
- Copied Wilson's `src/` into `cltc-dynasty/src/` as the starting point
- Applied all CLTC-specific changes: branding ("CLTC 8 2017"), Firebase config, league ID, error message copy
- Fixed admin "View As" dropdown — was showing hardcoded Wilson's owner names, now reads dynamically from `owners` prop (derived from `data.teamOverview`)
- Fixed Blueprint page loading spinners stuck indefinitely:
  - Removed `!myOutlook` from `GoalsSection` useEffect guard (was blocking load when owner name didn't match)
  - Added `.catch` handlers to all three loading useEffects (Goals, Watchlist, Suggestions) so Firestore errors surface in the console instead of silently leaving `loading = true`

### GitHub Actions Auto-Update Pipeline (Complete)
- Wilson's: `.github/workflows/update_data.yml` — runs Sun/Thu at 14:00 UTC (8am CST)
- CLTC: `.github/workflows/update_cltc_data.yml` — runs Sun/Thu at 14:00 UTC (8am CST)
- Both workflows commit and push updated JSON files; Vercel auto-deploys on each push
- `OUTPUT_DIR` uses `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` so scripts work locally and in CI

### Wilson's — Authentication (Complete)
- Firebase Auth with email/password login
- Signup verifies Sleeper username exists in league via API
- Login accepts email OR Sleeper username
- Session persists across devices
- Admin "view as" mode for ekleiner1123 — dropdown in sidebar, visual indicator when active
- All existing pages remain public; only /blueprint requires login

### Wilson's — Trade Calculator Updates (Complete)
- Stud tax rewritten to match KTC's methodology (see CLAUDE.md Trade Calculator Details)
- Need-based multiplier: +5% max, only for players with KTC > 4500
- QB need uses top 2 QBs (superflex) — both must rank bottom 3 to trigger
- Roster context adjustment: Rebuild receives young players +8%, Contender -5%
- Pick outlook adjustment: YEARS[1] and YEARS[2] only
- Team fit indicator shows which teams might want your assets

### Wilson's — Blueprint Page (Complete)
- Route: /blueprint, requires login
- All Firestore data (goals, watchlist, dismissals) saved by uid — never by rosterOwnerName
- Admin view-as does not affect watchlist or goals — always loads logged-in user's uid data
- Sections: Goals → Watchlist → Value Proportion card → Trade Strategy → Top Priorities → Trade Suggestions → Trade Finder

### Wilson's — Power Rankings (Complete)
- **Notebook:** `notebooks/power_rankings.ipynb` — pulls Sleeper users/rosters, reads existing `public/data/` JSONs (teamOverview, playerUniverse, rosterGrades, tradeHistory, positionalProportion), formats a structured prompt, makes one Anthropic API call (`claude-sonnet-4-6`), writes `public/data/power_rankings.json`
- **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/power_rankings.yml` — runs every **Tuesday at 15:00 UTC** (9am CT); requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a GitHub Actions repository secret
- **React page:** `src/pages/PowerRankings.js` — rank numbers color-coded (gold #1, green top 3, orange 7–8, red 9–10), outlook badges, AI disclaimer footer with `generated_at` timestamp
- **Wired into:** `dataService.js` (fetches `power_rankings.json`), `App.jsx` (`/powerrankings` route), `Sidebar.jsx` (nav item between League History and My Blueprint)
- **Required Python packages:** `anthropic`, `python-dotenv` — installed inline in the workflow
- **Local API key:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` at repo root (gitignored); loaded via `find_dotenv(usecwd=True)` from `notebooks/`
- **CLTC does not have this feature** — not started, do not add

### Wilson's — Trade Finder (Complete)
- `src/utils/playerUtils.js` — `normalizeName()` and `findPlayerByName()` handle name variants
- Template reordering — Cornerstone/Foundational give-side floats qualifying packages to top
- Cornerstone fairness filter — gate widens to `ratio >= 1.00 && ratio <= 1.35` when giving a Cornerstone
- Candidate pool bias — 1st-round-pick packages floated when `requireFirstRound === true`

## Known Issues

None currently. Both leagues are stable and auto-updating.

## Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1 — New Features
1. **Competitive Window / Age Runway** — core age, peak window years, projected value curve by year, age runway bar (Young/Prime/Late Prime/Aging). Add to Team Deep Dive and Blueprint pages.
2. **Dynasty Matrix** — grid of Rising/Prime/Aging player counts by position. Add to Team Deep Dive.
3. **Prime Windows Chart** — horizontal per-player timeline showing Rising → Prime → Declining phases sorted by value. Add to Team Deep Dive.
4. **Position Distribution with Age Buckets** — Under 23 / 23-26 / 27-30 / 31+ player counts with value. Add to Team Deep Dive.
5. **Trade Value Trajectory** — line chart of roster KTC value over time. Requires snapshot storage strategy. Add to Home or Blueprint.

### Phase 2 — Existing Feature Upgrades
6. **BUY/SELL/HOLD Signal + Hype %** column on Team Deep Dive roster table.
7. **Pick Portfolio visual card upgrade** — year-grouped cards with Sent badges like Dynatyze.
8. **Power Rankings bar chart** alongside AI narratives.
9. **Blueprint trade targets visual upgrade**.

### Phase 3 — Future
10. **Multi-league / Sleeper username input** — full architectural rework to support any user entering their Sleeper league ID and pulling their own league data dynamically.

## Next Steps

No outstanding work. Next changes will be feature additions or bug fixes as they arise.

When adding features, apply changes to **both** leagues:
- Wilson's: `src/`
- CLTC: `cltc-dynasty/src/`

Shared utilities (`tradeLogic.js`, `playerUtils.js`, Blueprint sections) should stay in sync between both codebases.
